# Specification Quality Checklist: Linear-GitHub Automation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is ready for planning

### Content Quality Review

- **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS - Specification focuses on what/why without mentioning specific technologies (TypeScript, Linear SDK, etc. were intentionally avoided)
- **User value focus**: ✅ PASS - All user stories describe developer pain points and automation benefits
- **Non-technical language**: ✅ PASS - Written for product/business stakeholders with clear user journeys
- **Mandatory sections**: ✅ PASS - All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

### Requirement Completeness Review

- **No clarification markers**: ✅ PASS - All requirements are specific and actionable without [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- **Testable requirements**: ✅ PASS - Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by parsing a tasks.md file)
- **Measurable success criteria**: ✅ PASS - All SC items include specific metrics (100%, 60 seconds, 95%, 5 minutes)
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: ✅ PASS - Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not system internals
- **Acceptance scenarios**: ✅ PASS - Each user story has 4-5 Given-When-Then scenarios
- **Edge cases**: ✅ PASS - Six edge cases identified covering conflicts, errors, and boundary conditions
- **Scope boundaries**: ✅ PASS - Three user stories with clear priorities define MVP (P1) vs enhancement (P2)
- **Dependencies/assumptions**: ✅ PASS - Implicit assumption documented: Speckit tasks.md format is stable

### Feature Readiness Review

- **Clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS - 15 functional requirements map to user story acceptance scenarios
- **Primary flows covered**: ✅ PASS - Three user stories cover: task sync (P1), PR integration (P1), bidirectional updates (P2)
- **Measurable outcomes**: ✅ PASS - 8 success criteria align with user stories and requirements
- **No implementation leaks**: ✅ PASS - No mentions of specific implementation approaches or technologies

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- No issues identified requiring spec updates
- All user stories are independently testable as required
- Assumptions: Tasks.md format remains stable across Speckit versions (low risk)
