# Feature Specification: Linear-GitHub Automation

**Feature Branch**: `001-linear-github-sync`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Automate synchronization between Speckit tasks, Linear issues, and GitHub pull requests"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Task Registration (Priority: P1)

A development team completes their feature specification using Speckit and runs the task generation command. The system reads the generated tasks.md file and automatically creates corresponding Linear issues for each task without requiring any manual data entry.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the automation. Without automatic task registration, teams fall back to error-prone manual entry, defeating the purpose of the integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the sync command on a tasks.md file and verifying all tasks appear as Linear issues with correct metadata (title, description, dependencies, user story tags).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tasks.md file with 10 tasks, **When** the sync command runs, **Then** 10 Linear issues are created with matching titles and descriptions
2. **Given** tasks have priority markers [P] and user story tags [US1], **When** issues are created, **Then** Linear labels reflect these markers
3. **Given** a task has dependencies listed, **When** the issue is created, **Then** the Linear issue description includes dependency information
4. **Given** a sync has already run, **When** the sync command runs again, **Then** no duplicate issues are created
5. **Given** a task in tasks.md is updated, **When** sync runs, **Then** the corresponding Linear issue is updated to match
6. **Given** existing Linear issues are found during initial sync, **When** the sync command runs, **Then** the system prompts the user to confirm whether to overwrite or keep existing issues

### User Story 2 - Zero-Input PR Integration (Priority: P1)

A developer is working on a feature branch that corresponds to a Linear issue (e.g., ABC-123-implement-login). When they create a pull request on GitHub, the PR description automatically includes the Linear issue ID and task name without requiring the developer to manually type or copy-paste anything.

**Why this priority**: This is equally critical as P1 because it ensures 100% traceability between code changes and Linear tasks. Manual PR annotation is frequently forgotten.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a PR from a feature branch and verifying the PR description contains the correct Linear issue reference in a format that Linear auto-detects and links.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a branch named "ABC-123-implement-login", **When** a PR is created, **Then** the PR title includes "ABC-123"
2. **Given** a branch with a Linear issue ID, **When** the PR description is generated, **Then** it includes a link to the Linear issue
3. **Given** a developer makes commits with the issue ID in commit messages, **When** a PR is created, **Then** the PR aggregates all related commits
4. **Given** a PR is created without a Linear issue in the branch name, **When** the system detects this, **Then** a warning is displayed to the developer
5. **Given** multiple commits on a branch, **When** a PR is created, **Then** the PR description includes a summary of changes from commit messages

---

### User Story 3 - Bidirectional Status Sync (Priority: P2)

When a developer's pull request is merged on GitHub, the corresponding Linear issue automatically transitions to "Done" status. Conversely, when a Linear issue is updated (status change, assignee change, comments), the GitHub PR reflects these updates.

**Why this priority**: This completes the automation loop but is slightly lower priority than P1 because teams can manually update status if needed. However, it significantly reduces manual overhead.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by merging a PR and checking Linear issue status, and by updating a Linear issue and checking the corresponding GitHub PR for updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR linked to Linear issue ABC-123, **When** the PR is merged, **Then** ABC-123 transitions to "Done" status in Linear
2. **Given** a Linear issue is assigned to a developer, **When** the assignment changes, **Then** the GitHub PR assignee is updated to match
3. **Given** a comment is added to a Linear issue, **When** the sync runs, **Then** the comment appears on the linked GitHub PR
4. **Given** a PR review is requested on GitHub, **When** the sync runs, **Then** the Linear issue shows the review request status
5. **Given** both Linear and GitHub are updated simultaneously, **When** a sync conflict occurs, **Then** GitHub updates take precedence and the conflict is logged for audit

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a tasks.md file contains task titles matching existing Linear issue titles during initial sync? (Answer: User is prompted to confirm overwrite or keep existing)
- How does the system handle branch names that don't follow the expected Linear ID pattern?
- What happens when Linear API rate limits are reached during bulk task creation?
- How does the system handle deleted Linear issues that still have corresponding GitHub PRs?
- What happens when a PR is created from a branch that maps to multiple Linear issues?
- How does the system handle offline scenarios where GitHub or Linear is temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly excluded from this automation system:

- **Multi-repository support**: The system is designed to operate on a single repository with one Linear team configuration
- **GitHub Actions integration**: Direct integration with GitHub Actions/CI-CD pipelines is not supported; the system operates independently of workflow automation

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST parse tasks.md files generated by /speckit.tasks command and extract task metadata (ID, title, description, user story tags, parallel markers, dependencies)
- **FR-002**: System MUST create Linear issues via the Linear API for each task in tasks.md without requiring manual user input, using a single configured Linear team per repository
- **FR-003**: System MUST store a mapping file that links task titles to Linear issue IDs and suggested branch names, with permanent retention (no automatic deletion)
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect Linear issue IDs from Git branch names using the pattern [A-Z]+-[0-9]+ (e.g., ABC-123)
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically populate GitHub PR descriptions with Linear issue references when PRs are created
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle Linear API rate limits gracefully with exponential backoff and retry logic (maximum 3 attempts)
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent duplicate Linear issue creation when sync command is run multiple times on the same tasks.md, and prompt user for confirmation when existing Linear issues are detected during initial sync
- **FR-008**: System MUST update existing Linear issues when corresponding tasks in tasks.md are modified
- **FR-009**: System MUST transition Linear issues to "Done" status when corresponding GitHub PRs are merged
- **FR-010**: System MUST synchronize Linear issue comments to GitHub PR comments and vice versa
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect sync conflicts when both Linear and GitHub are updated simultaneously and apply GitHub-takes-precedence resolution (GitHub updates override Linear changes, with conflict logged for audit)
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain eventual consistency between Linear and GitHub within 60 seconds under normal operation
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate webhook signatures to prevent spoofing attacks
- **FR-014**: System MUST emit structured logs for every sync operation, task mapping, and PR annotation
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for monitoring service availability
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow configuration of a single Linear team ID per repository for all issue creation operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: Represents a work item from tasks.md (attributes: ID, title, description, user story tag, priority marker, dependencies, status)
- **Linear Issue**: Represents a Linear workspace issue (attributes: identifier, title, description, status, assignee, labels, URL)
- **Task Mapping**: Links tasks to Linear issues with permanent retention (attributes: task title, Linear issue ID, Linear issue URL, suggested branch name, creation timestamp)
- **Pull Request**: Represents a GitHub PR (attributes: number, title, description, branch name, status, merge state, linked Linear issue)
- **Sync Event**: Records synchronization operations (attributes: timestamp, operation type, source, target, status, error message if failed)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-21

- Q: When both Linear and GitHub are updated simultaneously, how should the system resolve the conflict? → A: GitHub takes precedence - GitHub updates always override Linear changes
- Q: When creating issues in Linear, how should the system determine which Linear team/project to assign issues to? → A: Single fixed team - one Linear team per repository
- Q: When running sync command for the first time (existing Linear issues may already exist), how should the system behave? → A: User confirmation - prompt user whether to overwrite or keep existing issues when found
- Q: How long should mapping data (task-to-Linear issue mappings) be preserved in the mapping file? → A: Permanent retention - mapping data is never automatically deleted and continues to accumulate
- Q: What features should be explicitly excluded from this automation system's scope? → A: Multi-repository support and GitHub Actions integration are out of scope
